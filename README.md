This Chatbot is primarly focused for an CyberSecurity based Industry. It can be a customer care Chatbot by using which you can know which kind of services does the Cyber Industry provides. Also you can use this chatbot to know some basic terminologies in Cyber Industry like ; What is cryptography ?, What is Hashing ?, etc.
